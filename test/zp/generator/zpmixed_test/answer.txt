Summary
The slice() method extracts a section of a string and returns a new string.

Syntax
str.slice(beginSlice[, endSlice])
Parameters

beginSlice
The zero-based index at which to begin extraction. If negative, it is treated as (sourceLength+beginSlice) where sourceLength is the length of the string (for example, if beginSlice is -3 it is treated as sourceLength-3).
endSlice
The zero-based index at which to end extraction. If omitted, slice extracts to the end of the string. If negative, it is treated as (sourceLength+endSlice) where sourceLength is the length of the string.
Description
slice extracts the text from one string and returns a new string. Changes to the text in one string do not affect the other string.

slice extracts up to but not including endSlice. str.slice(1,4) extracts the second character through the fourth character (characters indexed 1, 2, and 3).

As an example, str.slice(2,-1) extracts the third character through the second to last character in the string.

Examples
Example: Using slice to create a new string

The following example uses slice to create a new string.

// assumes a print function is defined
var str1 = "The morning is upon us.";
var str2 = str1.slice(4, -2);

alert(str2); // OUTPUT: morning is upon u
The zero-based index at which to begin extraction. If negative, it is treated as (sourceLength+beginSlice) where sourceLength is the length of the string (for example, if beginSlice is -3 it is treated as sourceLength-3).
